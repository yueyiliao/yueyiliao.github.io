about_content: |-
  ### **Introduction**
  - I am a senior at the **University of California, Riverside**, majoring in **Psychology**, and an **applicant for the Global Hospitality and Culinary Arts programs** at **New York University** and the **Culinary Institute of America**.
  - As an aspiring culinary and hospitality professional, my goal is to combine my understanding of human behavior with my passion for food and service to create genuine, luxurious, and memorable banquet experiences.

  ### **Experience and Growth**
  - Hosted cultural and themed dinners for international students far from home, volunteered in community hospitality services, and organized pastry-making events supporting the local autism community.
  - Through these experiences, I have gained hands-on skills in food preparation, event coordination, and teamwork — and learned how hospitality brings people together through warmth, care, and thoughtful attention to detail.

  ### **Work Ethic and Values**
  - Reliable, calm under pressure, and attentive to every detail — whether serving guests, collaborating with a team, or preparing a dish.
  - Remain professional and composed in fast-paced environments, always striving to deliver comfort and care through genuine service.

  ### **Professional Training**
  - ServSafe Food Protection Manager, California Food Handling, and Responsible Beverage Service.
  - SHRM Essentials of Human Resources — teamwork, organizational communication, inclusive leadership.
  - Currently pursuing advanced training and preparing for an **internship (April–August 2026)** to gain practical experience in **hospitality operations** (event & banquet) and **kitchen management** (restaurants & bars).

  ### **Career Vision**
  My long-term goal is to continue growing in the hospitality industry, developing my craft through lifelong learning, teamwork, and dedication to excellent service.
  I aspire to create meaningful hospitality experiences that **celebrate culture**, **value sustainability**, **respect community**, and **foster human connection**.
