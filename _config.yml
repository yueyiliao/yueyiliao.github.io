about_content: | 
  I am an aspiring culinary and hospitality professional currently studying Psychology at the University of California, Riverside.  
  My goal is to combine my understanding of human behavior with my passion for food and hospitality to create meaningful, guest-centered dining experiences.  

  Over the past few years, I’ve hosted cultural and themed dinners, organized community events, and gained hands-on food service experience through cooking, event planning, and leadership roles.  
  I take pride in my attention to detail, reliability, and warmth in every interaction — whether welcoming guests or preparing a meal.

  I am currently pursuing professional culinary training through the **Culinary Institute of America’s Accelerated Culinary Arts Certificate Program**, alongside certifications in **ServSafe**, **Food Handling**, and **Responsible Beverage Service**.  

  <mark>My career vision</mark> is to grow in the hospitality industry, continuously learning the art of service, teamwork, and culinary excellence.
